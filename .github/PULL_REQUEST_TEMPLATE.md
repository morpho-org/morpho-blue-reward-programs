## Context

Please, provide here any context that could help us to validate the Reward Program(s).

## Merge conditions checklist

- [ ] Ensure there is at least one week between the PR submission and the start of the Program(s).
- [ ] Send funds to the URD; the PR will only be merged after the funds have been received.
- [ ] Transaction link(s) for the funds transfer(s) to URD(s): <div style="color: orange;">[Insert transaction link here]</div>

**Important**: If the delay between the PR creation and the start of the Program(s) is less than one week, or if we do not see any funds sent to the URD, the PR will not be merged, and the Program(s) will not be created.
